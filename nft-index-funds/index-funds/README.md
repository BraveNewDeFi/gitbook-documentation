# Index Funds by NFTX

NFTX builds an ecosystem that allows anyone, anywhere to create, participate and/or invest into 1:1 NFT-backed index funds.  
  
While the NFTX infrastructure is completely permissionless, the NFTX DAO provides liquidity for a limited section of all available funds.   
  
The categories for which the DAO provides liquidity, including their contract addresses & links to liquidity pools, are listed below.
