# Index Funds by NFTX

NFTX builds an ecosystem that allows anyone, anywhere to create, participate and/or invest into 1:1 NFT-backed index funds.

While the NFTX infrastructure is completely permissionless, the NFTX DAO provides liquidity for a limited section of all available funds. 

The categories for which the DAO provides liquidity, including their contract addresses & links to liquidity pools, are listed below.

Below are defined terms for the following sections:
* **Combined fund**: a fund that is made up of other single-fund tokens. This type of fund was previously referred to as a D2 fund during the pre-launch phase; this type of fund was then referred to as a top-level fund. Now, **NFTX refers to this type of fund as a combined fund**.

* **Single fund**: a fund that has 1:1 backing between a single NFT contract and the ERC20 contract. This type of fund was previously referred to as a D1 fund during the pre-launch phase; this type of fund was then referred to as an input fund. Now, **NFTX refers to this type of fund as a single fund**.
